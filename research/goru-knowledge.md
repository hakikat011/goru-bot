3.  **Operational Risks:** E.g., Operations & Process Risk, Supply Chain Risk, Cyber Security Risk, Fraud Risk, IT Risk, Loss of IP Risk, Regulatory & Compliance Risk.

The framework assists organizations by ensuring comprehensive coverage, enhancing risk identification, strategic alignment, and improved decision-making.

### 5.2. Recommended Startup Risk Management Activities

Gōru suggests four key activities for implementing risk management:

1.  **Risk Identification:** Identifying the specific business risk that could arise.
2.  **Risk Assessment:** Discussing the nature, likelihood, and financial/operational impact of the risk.
